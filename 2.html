<br> <strong> MC</strong>: Good evening, listeners.
This is your DJ, Breeze.
Today we have a pecial guest, Andy Kim.
He's a hip-hop artist.
Welcome, Andy.
<br><strong>Andy Kim</strong>: Nice to meet you and thank you for having me.
<br><strong>  MC</strong>: Okay, What do our listeners want to tell their family?
This evening we will find out by reading some letters from them.
Andy, will you start off with the letter from a teenage girl?
<br><strong>Andy Kim</strong>: Sure

<br><strong>  Letter</strong>: Hello, I'm a 15-year-old girl from Wonju.
I want to tell you about my mom.
My mom tries to do everything for me.
She cleans my room without asking me, so it's sometimes hard to find my stuff.
She also buys books and makes me study them.
I want to say to my mom.
"I know you love me, but I'm not a baby anymore.
Please let me taSke care of things myself"
<br><strong>  MC</strong>: I felt the same way when I was in middle school.
Andy Kim: Many moms think their kids are too young to do things on their own.
I hope the girl's mom will get the message.
<br><strong>  MC</strong>: So do I.
Andy, will you please read the next letter?
</p>
<p style="margin-top:30px;">
<br><strong>  Letter</strong>: Hi. I'm a father of two children.
One is a high school girl, and the other is a middle schoolboy.
They're too busy to talk with me.
When I get home from work, they just say hi and go back to their rooms.
Sometimes I ask them about their school life, but they only give short answers.
We don't talk much at the table, either.
I want to say to my kids, "I love you so much, and I want to spend more time with you"
<br><strong>  MC</strong>: Andy, did you talk with your parents often when you were younger?
<br><strong>  Andy Kim</strong>: Not really.
I loved them very much, but I thought they were too old to understand me.
<br><strong>  MC</strong>: I see.
Does anyone have suggestions for the "sad" dad?
Text your idea to us.
