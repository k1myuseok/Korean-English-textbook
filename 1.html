    In many ways, 42-years-old Joseph Palmer was an <a title="1. 보통의, 일상적인 2. 평범한
  specification"><strong>ordinary</strong></a> person
  He had a job and cared for his family.
  But in 1830, after he moved to a small town in
<a title="매사추세츠(미국 북동부의 주) specification"><strong>Massachusetts</strong></a>,
  he began to <a title="난관에 봉착하다 specification"><strong>face difficulties</strong></a>.
  Joseph looked different from other people: he had a long beard.
  People did not like it very much.
  <br>  The towns people avoided the man with a beard.
  They did not want to sit next to him.
  They <a title ="심지어 specification"><strong>even</strong></a>
<a title="1. 속삭이다, 소곤거리다, 귓속말을 하다. 2. 은밀히 말하다. 3. (소곤거리듯이) 살랑거리다. specification">
<strong>  whispered </strong></a>
  behind his back, "What is he trying to hide?"

<p style="margin-top:30px;">
    Some neighbors broke his windows.
  Others threw stones at him when he walked down the street.
  They told him to stop growing a beard.
  joseph did not mind.
  They did not want to sit next to him.
<br>
    One day, four men attacked Joseph and threw him on the ground.
  "We're going to cut off your beard!" they shouted.
  Joseph was a big man, and he was able to fight them off.
  But the men called the police and accused him of attacking them.
  Poor Joseph was <a title="1. 체포하다. 2. (무엇의 진행을) 막다. 3. (시선, 관심을) 끌다. specification">
<strong>  arrested </strong></a>.
  He said to the judge, "I'm the <a title="1. (범죄, 질병, 사고 등의) 피해자. 2. (속임수를 당한) 피해자. 3. 제물, 희생물 specification">
<strong>victim</strong></a> here."
  Sadly, no one believed a man with a beard, and he went to prison for <a title="1년 이상 specification">
<strong>over a year</strong></a>
</p>
<p style="margin-top:30px;">
    Joseph's son, Thomas, wanted people to know the truth.
  He sent letters to newspapers across the country.
  People learned that Joseph was in prison just for protecting himselfs and his beard.
  Many people became angry about this, so the judge finally decided to set Joseph free.
  <br>
  After he was freed, Joseph traveled and told his story to lots of people.
  Slowly, people's attitudes <a title="...쪽으로, ...향하여. specification">
<strong>toward</strong></a> beards changed.
  Before Joseph died, a man with a beard became the President of the United States.
  His name was Abraham Lincoln. He made beards popular, but Joseph Palmer fought for the right to have them.
